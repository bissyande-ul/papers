Mutation analysis is a powerful technique with several applications on
software development activities. Thus, mutants can be used to drive the
generation of test cases, the creation of oracles, the fault-localization
process and to assess the testing thoroughness. However, mutation analysis is
computationally expensive since it requires the test execution of a vast
number of mutants. This paper suggests the use of several optimizations
capable of reducing this overhead. The proposed optimizations have been
integrated into a mutation analysis tool for C and C++ programs. Empirical
results suggest that mutation analysis is feasible and practically applicable
to real word programs.
