Software testing plays an important part in software development projects
where testing tasks can often account for over 50\% of the time expended and
of the development cost of a program~\cite{myers2011art}. Given the
investments on software testing, developers must ensure that the employed test
suites are adequate to thoroughly uncover hidden bugs in program code. In
practice, practitionners rely on (in)adequacy criteria, i.e., a set of test
obligations, to assess the adequacy/thoroughness of a test suite. Mutation
analysis is such a test adequacy criterion that is well-known by both
practitionners and researchers.
